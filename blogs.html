            I am the best. I want to be the best. <br><br>
            That's why I try and try. I make a routine, I make a plan, try to fullfill it. But I can't. Even though I can't, I still don't think about it. I make another plan and try to fullfill it and fail again. But I don't care. I make it again. <br><br>
            Still I think that I'm the best. I think that I'll be the best in the world. I'm special. No one is better than me. <br><br>
            The person who stays with me- I'm better than him. <br>
            The people around me- they aren't better than me. <br>
            I am the best. <br>
            I still think and fail. 
            He is walking around me. He did well better than me. I still think I'm better than him. <br>
            People are getting succeed and I still think that their success is useless. I am better than him. <br>
            Is it okey? I don't know. I think again and again. I try to understand. But can't realize. I am trying to realize but I can't. Why? Why all these things are happennig to me? Just why? I don't know. <br><br>
            Maybe I got the answer. I've been suffering from over-thinking. Yes. I think a lot but don't understand. <br><br>
            The person who was with me, now did well. I come to realize that his success is not useless. <br>
            The people who are making wonderful things that seem to useless to me- they aren't useless. <br>
            I finally realized. But it is not enough. I lost everything because I thouht I am the best wihtout thinking me as a part of the society. Actually I'm the useless one who does nothing but thinking. <br>
            There is no difinition of success, maybe. I don't know. I don't want to think about it again. I can't. I faild. <br>
            I am me that's what I didn't realized. <br> <br>
            Maybe.

            Time to shine.! <br><br>
            He wakes up regularly at 6. Then he goes to his office. He has to work to get money. He needs money because he needs to run his family. He does this everyday without changing anything. He doesn't want to do this but he does. Nothing changes. <br><br>
            She wakes up regularly at 5. Prepares breakfast. Does her work like a robot and does nothing. Nothing gets changed, even though she wants a change. <br><br>
            We need change. Everyone wants something new. Everyone wants to change their everyday life. They wants something new. They just want it and get quite and does their everyday work over and over again. <br><br>
            We have to do something new. We are not robots. New things is the key get our mind in our way. We have to make new things. something creative must be done. Once you have cleared the idea of change, once you know how to change and break the usual rule without hesitating, trust me you're free. Just go do. You as you are. Just go and shine. <br><br>
            Trust me, you are ok with this. Just go and shine. It's time to shine.
